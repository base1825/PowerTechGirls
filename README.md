# EMPOWERING THE NATIONS
## Project Overview
This mobile application was developed for a local small-to-medium enterprise (SME) initiative founded by Precious Radebe, whose goal is to empower members of her community through skills development and vocational training.

The SME offers practical courses designed to upskill domestic workers and gardeners, helping them become more employable and better compensated for their work. By gaining additional skills, trainees are also equipped to start their own small businesses, promoting entrepreneurship and self-sustainability within local communities.

The Empowering the Nation mobile app supports this vision by providing a digital platform through which:

Potential learners and employers can explore available training courses,

Users can receive quotations for selected services or training packages, and

The enterprise can promote its offerings to a broader audience beyond the immediate community.

This project demonstrates how mobile technology can be applied to address socioeconomic challenges by bridging the gap between education, employment, and digital accessibility.

## Design CONSIDERATIONS
The visual design of the PowerTechGirls application follows a modern and professional aesthetic that reflects empowerment, growth, and excellence. The chosen color palette includes black, green, gold, and white, each selected with purpose:

Black represents strength, professionalism, and stability, creating a strong visual foundation.

Green symbolizes growth, learning, and renewal—values that align with the training and upskilling mission of the project.

Gold conveys achievement, success, and quality, reinforcing the organization’s vision of empowerment through education.

White ensures clarity and readability, balancing the darker tones and maintaining a clean interface.

The user interface was designed to be accessible, simple to navigate, and visually consistent across all screens. The layout uses adequate spacing, legible typography, and well-defined button elements to enhance the user experience on various Android devices.
